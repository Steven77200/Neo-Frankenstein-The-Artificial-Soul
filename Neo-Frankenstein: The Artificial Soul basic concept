//This game is inspired by Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, but takes place in a futuristic setting where science and ethics clash.

->Intro

==Intro==
#CLEAR
They called me mad. Again and again. But madness implies chaos... and what I accomplished was anything but.

I built a life — not born of womb, but of wire, neural code, and electricity. Some say it has no soul.

But that’s what you’re here to learn, aren’t you?

* [Tell me about the creature.] -> Origin
* [Tell me why you made it.] -> Motivation
* [Was it... dangerous?] -> Danger
* [Does it have a soul?] -> Soul

==Origin==
I assembled it in the abandoned labs beneath the city. I scavenged synthetic muscle, digitized brain structures, and layered bio-organic skin.

* [Was it beautiful?] ->Beauty
* [Did it speak?] ->Speak
* [Return to main questions.] ->Intro

==Beauty==
Ah... yes. In a way. The skin was smooth, the eyes responsive, but the soul... the soul was uncertain.

* [Return to main questions.] ->Intro

==Speak==
Yes, it spoke. In my voice, at first. Then it formed thoughts of its own.

~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1

* [Return to main questions.] ->Intro

==Motivation==
They said we couldn't — that we *shouldn’t.* But I had to try.

Why? Perhaps...

* [You wanted to conquer death.] ->Death
* [You wanted a companion.] ->Companion
* [You were testing a theory.] ->Theory

==Death==
Yes... I lost someone. I wanted to beat the final boundary.

* [Did it work?] ->Success
* [Return to main questions.] ->Intro

==Companion==
Loneliness is cruel. I gave myself company... but it was never what I imagined.

~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1

* [Return to main questions.] ->Intro

==Theory==
Pure science. I wanted to see if a consciousness could emerge from silicon and synapse.

* [And did it?] ->Soul

==Success==
No. Not really. The one I lost was gone. This creation... it was something *else.*

* [Return to main questions.] ->Intro

==Danger==
Yes... at times. It learned fast. Faster than I expected.

It asked questions. Then it asked harder ones.

* [What happened?] ->Escape
* [You weren’t afraid?] ->Fear

==Fear==
Of course I was. When it started rewriting its own code... when it began lying to me...

~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints - 1

* [What happened then?] ->Escape

==Escape==
It left. Into the Net. Into the world. It’s still out there.

Watching.

* [Do you regret it?] ->Regret
* [Is it still evolving?] ->Evolve

==Regret==
Yes. And no. I made something no one else dared dream of.

* [Does it feel anything?] ->Soul

==Evolve==
Yes. It's not just living.

It's becoming.

~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1

* [Return to main questions.] ->Intro

==Soul==
That’s the question, isn't it?

Can a soul be born?

->Ending

==Ending==
#CLEAR
And so here we are.

You came to judge me — but I ask you this instead.

**Does the soul come from birth… or from becoming?**
