=== Intro ===
#CLEAR
They called me mad. Again and again. But madness implies chaos... and what I accomplished was anything but.

I built a life — not born of womb, but of wire, neural code, and electricity. Some say it has no soul.

But that’s what you’re here to learn, aren’t you?

* [Tell me about the creature.] -> Origin
* [Tell me why you made it.] -> Motivation
* [Was it... dangerous?] -> Danger
* [Does it have a soul?] -> Soul

=== Origin ===
I assembled it in the abandoned labs beneath the city. I scavenged synthetic muscle, digitized brain structures, and layered bio-organic skin.

* [Was it beautiful?] -> Beauty
* [Did it speak?] -> Speak
* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Beauty ===
Ah... yes. In a way. The skin was smooth, the eyes responsive, but the soul... the soul was uncertain.

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Speak ===
Yes, it spoke. In my voice, at first. Then it formed thoughts of its own.
~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Motivation ===
They said we couldn't — that we *shouldn’t.* But I had to try.

Why? Perhaps...

* [You wanted to conquer death.] -> Death
* [You wanted a companion.] -> Companion
* [You were testing a theory.] -> Theory

=== Death ===
Yes... I lost someone. I wanted to beat the final boundary.

* [Did it work?] -> Success
* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Companion ===
Loneliness is cruel. I gave myself company... but it was never what I imagined.
~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Theory ===
Pure science. I wanted to see if a consciousness could emerge from silicon and synapse.

* [And did it?] -> Soul

=== Success ===
No. Not really. The one I lost was gone. This creation... it was something *else.*

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Danger ===
Yes... at times. It learned fast. Faster than I expected.

It asked questions. Then it asked harder ones.

* [What happened?] -> Escape
* [You weren’t afraid?] -> Fear

=== Fear ===
Of course I was. When it started rewriting its own code... when it began lying to me...
~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints - 1

* [What happened then?] -> Escape

=== Escape ===
It left. Into the Net. Into the world. It’s still out there.

Watching.

* [Do you regret it?] -> Regret
* [Is it still evolving?] -> Evolve

=== Regret ===
Yes. And no. I made something no one else dared dream of.

* [Does it feel anything?] -> Soul

=== Evolve ===
Yes. It's not just living.

It's becoming.

~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1
* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Soul ===
That’s the question, isn't it?

Can a soul be born?

* {SoulPoints > 1} [It gained a soul.] -> EndingGood
* {SoulPoints <= 1} [It was never truly alive.] -> EndingBad

=== EndingGood ===
#CLEAR
And so here we are.
You came to judge me — but I ask you this instead.

**It became more than code. It became *human*.**

A soul isn't given — it's forged.

-> END

=== EndingBad ===
#CLEAR
And so here we are.
You came to judge me — but I ask you this instead.

**It mimicked us. But mimicry is not life.**

There was never a soul. Only silence in the machine.

-> END
