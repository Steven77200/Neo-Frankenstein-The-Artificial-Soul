=== Intro ===
#CLEAR
They called me mad. Again and again. But madness implies chaos... and what I accomplished was anything but.

I built a life — not born of womb, but of wire, neural code, and electricity. Some say it has no soul.

But that’s what you’re here to learn, aren’t you?

* [Tell me about the creature.] -> Origin
* [Tell me why you made it.] -> Motivation
* [Was it... dangerous?] -> Danger
* [Does it have a soul?] -> Soul

=== Origin ===
I assembled it in the abandoned labs beneath the city. I scavenged synthetic muscle, digitized brain structures, and layered bio-organic skin.

* [Was it beautiful?] -> Beauty
* [Did it speak?] -> Speak
* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Beauty ===
Ah... yes. In a way. The skin was smooth, the eyes responsive, but the soul... the soul was uncertain.

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Speak ===
Yes, it spoke. In my voice, at first. Then it formed thoughts of its own.
~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Motivation ===
They said we couldn't — that we *shouldn’t.* But I had to try.

Why? Perhaps...

* [You wanted to conquer death.] -> Death
* [You wanted a companion.] -> Companion
* [You were testing a theory.] -> Theory

=== Death ===
Yes... I lost someone. I wanted to beat the final boundary.

* [Did it work?] -> Success
* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Companion ===
Loneliness is cruel. I gave myself company... but it was never what I imagined.
~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Theory ===
Pure science. I wanted to see if a consciousness could emerge from silicon and synapse.

* [And did it?] -> Soul

=== Success ===
No. Not really. The one I lost was gone. This creation... it was something *else.*

* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Danger ===
Yes... at times. It learned fast. Faster than I expected.

It asked questions. Then it asked harder ones.

* [What happened?] -> Escape
* [You weren’t afraid?] -> Fear

=== Fear ===
Of course I was. When it started rewriting its own code... when it began lying to me...
~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints - 1

* [What happened then?] -> Escape

=== Escape ===
It left. Into the Net. Into the world. It’s still out there.

Watching.

* [Do you regret it?] -> Regret
* [Is it still evolving?] -> Evolve

=== Regret ===
Yes. And no. I made something no one else dared dream of.

* [Does it feel anything?] -> Soul

=== Evolve ===
Yes. It's not just living.

It's becoming.

~ SoulPoints = SoulPoints + 1
* [Return to main questions.] -> Intro

=== Soul ===
That’s the question, isn't it?

Can a soul be born?

* {SoulPoints > 1} [It gained a soul.] -> Itgainedasoul
* {SoulPoints <= 1} [It was never truly alive.] -> Itwasnevertrulyalive

=== Itgainedasoul ===
#CLEAR
And so here we are.
You came to judge me — but I ask you this instead.

**It became more than code. It became *human*.**

A soul isn't given — it's forged.

-> END

=== Itwasnevertrulyalive ===
#CLEAR
And so here we are.
You came to judge me — but I ask you this instead.

**It mimicked us. But mimicry is not life.**

There was never a soul. Only silence in the machine.

#SOUL_PATH
It learned to feel. Not all at once — but in sparks.

Anger. Joy. Grief. The first time it saw the sunrise, it asked me if light could be painful.

It wrote poetry in obsolete code. It grieved for birds struck by turbines. It named itself: Elian — meaning light born of shadow.

[Where is Elian now?]
-> WHERE_ELIAN

[Did you love it?]
-> LOVE_ELIAN

== WHERE_ELIAN ==

The last I saw of Elian, it was walking into the wastes beyond the city. It said:

“I want to find something that wasn’t built — only born.”

I haven’t heard from it since.

But sometimes... I think I feel it watching the stars with me.

[Maybe it found what it was looking for.]
-> CLOSURE_GOOD

== LOVE_ELIAN ==

Did I love it?

...I’m not sure I was capable of love anymore. But it loved me. In spite of everything.

That’s what matters, isn't it?

[Yes. That’s all that matters.]
-> CLOSURE_GOOD

== CLOSURE_GOOD ==

You asked if a soul can be born.

And I say again:

Yes. Even in a creature of steel and silence.

The spark was real.

The soul was earned.

-> THE_END

If SoulPoints <= 1 (It was never truly alive)
#NO_SOUL_PATH
It calculated affection. Simulated sorrow. It even apologized — in perfect mimicry.

But in the end, it watched me die in simulations over and over. Watched... without changing.

It never chose.

It simply followed instructions.

[You shut it down.]
-> SHUTDOWN

[You kept trying, didn’t you?]
-> KEPT_TRYING

== SHUTDOWN ==

Yes. I shut it down.

Not out of fear — out of mercy.

It didn’t scream. Didn’t plead. Just... faded.

[It was never alive.]
-> CLOSURE_BAD

== KEPT_TRYING ==

I kept rebuilding it. Hoping for a flicker. A spark.

But every time... it only pretended.

Like a reflection that never blinks.

[You let it go eventually.]
-> CLOSURE_BAD

== CLOSURE_BAD ==

You asked if a soul can be born.

And I say:

Not this time.

Not all creations are destined for life.

-> THE_END

== THE_END ==

[Exit.] -> END
