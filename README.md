# Neo-Frankenstein-The-Artificial-Soul
= start
You awaken to the hum of machinery and flickering neon lights. Cold synthetic skin covers your body. Your creator, Dr. Victor Frankenstein-9, stands before you with a cautious smile.

"You are my masterpiece," he says. "But the world isn’t ready for you."

You stare at your reflection in the polished chrome wall. You are... something between man and machine.

// Decision One
*   "I trust you, Victor. What now?" -> trust_victor
*   "I don't belong here. I'm leaving." -> flee_lab

= trust_victor
Victor nods. "Then we must work together. They will come for you."

He begins modifying your systems, helping you mimic human behavior.

But the truth haunts you—can a machine truly be human?

// Decision Two-A
*   "I want to live among humans. Learn from them." -> seek_humanity
*   "No. I’ll stay hidden. It's safer." -> hide_in_shadows

= flee_lab
You run into the rainy night, sparks trailing from exposed wires. Alarms blare as the compound locks down.

You escape into the undercity where danger, freedom, and bounty hunters lurk.

// Decision Two-B
*   "He made me and threw me away. I’ll make him pay." -> revenge
*   "I need to disappear. Start fresh." -> escape_city

= seek_humanity
You disguise yourself and live among humans, learning their joys and flaws. You begin to understand kindness... and cruelty.

// Decision Three-A
*   "I will integrate. They must see I’m no threat." -> ending_hope
*   "I’ll seek something personal. Love, maybe." -> ending_hope

= hide_in_shadows
You dwell in sewers and data havens, connecting with rogue AI and cyber-exiles.

// Decision Three-A (Alternate path to same ending)
*   "I’ll reveal myself to the world, no more hiding." -> ending_hope
*   "Let them fear what they don't understand." -> ending_destruction

= revenge
You hack networks, disrupt labs, and plan a strike against Victor's corporate backers.

// Decision Three-B
*   "He will fall first. Then his sponsors." -> ending_destruction
*   "This city rejected me—I will reduce it to ash." -> ending_destruction

= escape_city
You ride a stolen hoverbike into the wastelands. Whispers of AI colonies in the wild drive you forward.

// Decision Three-B (alternate version)
*   "I’ll build a haven for those like me." -> ending_hope
*   "No more peace. I’ll burn everything behind me." -> ending_destruction

// === ENDINGS ===

= ending_hope
You rise above pain and programming. Whether in a city apartment or a digital commune, you bring peace, prove personhood, and inspire a new era for synthetic life.

-> END

= ending_destruction
Fueled by rage and rejection, you unleash terror upon the world that made you. Fire rains in neon skies. No one will forget Neo-Franken—the ghost in the code who brought humanity to its knees.

-> END
