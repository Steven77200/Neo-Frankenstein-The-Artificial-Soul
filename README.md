# Neo-Frankenstein: The Artificial Soul (Basic Version)

Welcome to the **basic version** of *Neo-Frankenstein: The Artificial Soul*, an interactive fiction story built using [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), inspired by Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* and reimagined with an anime cyberpunk twist.

This project contains the source code for the game, including four main decision points and two distinct endings. It's meant as a foundational draft that could later be expanded into a larger project.

## How to Access the Game Files

If you are looking to access the source code for the game (including some code comments from me on how it works), you can do that from here in several ways:

### Option 1: Clone with Git
If you're familiar with Git, you can clone this repository to your computer to make a copy of it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neo-frankenstein.git
